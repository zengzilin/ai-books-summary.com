## Introduction

The book Don't Trust Your Gut challenges our habit of relying on intuition to make decisions in several areas of life through big data and research. Covering nine areas, including marriage, parenting, athleticism, wealth accumulation, entrepreneurship, luck, appearance, pleasure and pain, the book reveals the conclusions of data analysis that run counter to intuition, and advocates using data thinking to optimize work and life and make better decisions.

Marriage: the book points out that what we actually seek in the marriage market, and what we should seek, are often two different things. For example, it is common to think that physical appearance, height, occupation, and personality are important considerations when looking for a partner, but the data suggests that these factors do not predict relationship happiness. On the contrary, a person who is happy when he is single is also more likely to be happy after he enters into an intimate relationship. This suggests that individual psychological traits, such as life satisfaction, secure attachment style, dutifulness, and growth mindset, are more important to marital happiness.

Parenting: The book mentions that parents have much less influence on their children than we usually think. Genetic factors affect a child's future earnings about 2.5 times more than the influence of acquired nurture. As a result, many of the decisions parents make in parenting have a small impact on the future development of their children. Still, aspects of a parent's own behavior, such as religious beliefs, drug use, alcohol use, and sexual behavior, can have an impact on a child. In addition, choosing where a child grows up to live can have a big impact on the child, with good neighborhoods boosting the child's future income level more dramatically.

Wealth Building: The book points out that most industries don't make rich people, and those that do make money are often inconspicuous. To make high profits, you need to have some sort of moat. For example, owning your own business, avoiding simple price competition, and not being undercut by giants.

Luck: The book discusses the relationship between luck and effort, noting that while we have to recognize the importance of luck, we still believe that effort is useful. Effort can improve luck, especially by working in the direction of luck and multiplying effort with luck.

Pleasure and Pain: The book also explores the perception of pleasure and pain, noting that people are often not good at assessing whether something is pleasurable or not. The reason we are unhappy may be because we don't “live in the moment” or we don't spend a lot of time doing things that make us truly happy.

Overall, Don't Trust Your Instincts offers a new way of looking at the big decisions in our lives through data analysis, and encourages us to use a data-driven approach to optimize our choices for better life outcomes.
