## Introduce
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language. It is a multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, declarative, functional, and procedural programming styles. Initially, JavaScript was used to enhance the interactivity of web pages, but it has since expanded to server-side (Node.js) and various desktop and mobile applications. Here are some basic knowledge points of JavaScript:

## Data Types:   

Primitive data types: Number, String, Boolean, Undefined, Null, Symbol (ES6), BigInt (ES2020).
Composite data types: Object (including Array, Function, Date, etc.).
Variable Declaration:

let: Block scope, does not allow redeclaration.
const: Block scope, cannot be changed after declaration.
var: Function scope or global scope, can be redeclared.
Operators:

Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, %, ++, --.
Comparison operators: ==, ===, !=, !==, >, <, >=, <=.
Logical operators: &&, ||, !.
Assignment operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, etc.
Control Flow:

Conditional statements: if, else if, else.
Loop statements: for, while, do...while, for...in, for...of (ES6).
Functions:

Declaring functions: function functionName() { ... }
Function expression: const functionName = function() { ... }
Arrow functions (ES6): const functionName = () => { ... }
Arrays:

Creating arrays: let array = [1, 2, 3];
Methods: map(), filter(), reduce(), forEach(), push(), pop(), shift(), unshift(), etc.
Objects:

Creating objects: let obj = { key: 'value' }; or let obj = new Object();
Methods: Object.keys(), Object.values(), Object.entries(), etc.
Prototypes and Inheritance:

Every object has a prototype object, which can contain properties and methods.
Use Object.create() to create instances of objects.
Asynchronous Programming:

Callback functions, Promises, async/await (ES2017).
ES6 and newer syntax features:

Template literals, destructuring assignment, spread operator, arrow functions, modules, classes, let and const, for...of loop, etc.
These are the basics of JavaScript programming. Mastering these concepts is crucial for further learning of JavaScript frameworks and libraries (such as React, Angular, Vue.js).
