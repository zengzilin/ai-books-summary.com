This novel focuses on the story of the four members of the Longevity Monk and his disciples as they seek the scriptures, and recounts their legendary experience of overcoming many difficulties along the way and finally obtaining the true scriptures. The following is a summary of the main content of Journey to the West:



The origin of the scriptures: the story begins during the time of Emperor Tang Taizong of the Great Tang Dynasty, when Venerable Xuanzang (the Tang Monk) is ordered by Emperor Tang Taizong to travel to the West (India) to retrieve the true scriptures in order to universalize all beings.

Piggy: Originally the Marshal of the Heavenly Puff, he was relegated to the mortal world due to a mistake. He is lazy, gluttonous and lustful, but loyal and reliable.

Sand Monk: Originally the general of the Rolling Curtain, he has a steady and hardworking character, and is the logistic support in the team.

Eighty-one Difficulties: In the process of fetching scriptures, the four masters and disciples experienced nine hundred and eighty-one difficulties, including battles with demons and devils, tests of the natural environment, and trials of the human heart.

Important Demons and Monsters: Many famous demons and monsters appear in the novel, such as the White Bone Monster, the Yellow Wind Monster, the Spider Spirit, the King Bull Demon, etc., and each of them has different magical powers and stories.

Help from Gods and Buddhas: On the way to fetch scriptures, the four masters and disciples were also helped by many Gods and Buddhas, such as Goddess of Mercy, Buddha Rulai, and so on.

Successful Fetching of Scriptures: After fourteen years of arduous trekking, the four masters and disciples finally reached the Western Paradise, obtained the real scriptures, and returned to the Great Tang Dynasty, completing the mission of fetching scriptures.
