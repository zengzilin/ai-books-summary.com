# Code Structure

The first thing we are going to learn is how to construct blocks of code.

## Statements

Statements are syntactic structures and commands that perform actions.

We have already seen statements like `alert('Hello, world!')` that can be used to display messages.

We can write any number of statements in our code. They can be separated by semicolons.

For example, we split the message "Hello World" into two parts:

```javascript
alert('Hello'); alert('World');
Usually, each statement occupies a line to improve the readability of the code:

javascript
alert('Hello');
alert('World');
Semicolons
When there are line breaks, semicolons can be omitted in most cases.

The following code can also run:

javascript
alert('Hello')
alert('World')
Here, JavaScript interprets the line break as an "implicit" semicolon. This is also known as automatic semicolon insertion.

In most cases, a line break means a semicolon. But "most cases" does not mean "always"!

There are many examples where line breaks are not semicolons, for example:

javascript
alert(3 +
1
+ 2);
The code outputs 6 because JavaScript does not insert a semicolon here. It is clear that if a line ends with a plus sign "+", it is an "incomplete expression" and does not need a semicolon. So, this example gets the expected result.

However, there are situations where JavaScript cannot determine whether an automatic semicolon insertion is really needed.

Errors that occur in this case are very difficult to find and solve.

An Example of an Error
If you are curious to know a specific example of this kind of error, you can take a look at the following code:

javascript
alert("Hello");

[1, 2].forEach(alert);
You don't need to consider the meaning of the square brackets [] and forEach for now; they are not important, and we will learn about them later. Let's first remember the result of this code: it displays Hello first, then 1, and then 2.

Now, let's remove the semicolon after the alert statement:

javascript
alert("Hello")

[1, 2].forEach(alert);
Compared to the code above, there is only one character difference: the semicolon at the end of the first line is missing.

If we run this code, only the first Hello will be displayed (and there will be an error, which you may need to open the console to see). And no numbers will be displayed anymore.

This is because the JavaScript engine does not assume that there is a semicolon before the square brackets [...]. Therefore, the code in the last example is considered a single statement.

For the engine, it looks like this:

javascript
alert("Hello")[1, 2].forEach(alert);
It looks strange, right? In this case, it is wrong to combine two lines of code together like this. We need to add a semicolon after the alert for the code to run properly.

This can also happen in other situations.

Even if statements are separated by line breaks, we still recommend adding semicolons between them. This rule is widely adopted by the community. We emphasize again â€” most of the time semicolons can be omitted, but it is best not to omit them, especially for beginners.

Comments
As time goes by, programs become more and more complex. Adding comments to the code to describe what it does and why it does so becomes very necessary.

You can add comments anywhere in the script, and they do not affect the execution of the code because the engine will ignore them directly.

Single-line comments start with two forward slash characters //.

The rest of the line is a comment. It can either be on a line by itself or follow a statement.

Like this:

javascript
// This comment is on a line by itself
alert('Hello');

alert('World'); // This comment follows a statement
Multiline comments start with a forward slash and an asterisk /* and end with an asterisk and a forward slash */.

Like this:

javascript
/* An example of two messages.
This is a multiline comment.
*/
alert('Hello');
alert('World');
The content of the comment is ignored, so if we put code inside /* ... */, it will not be executed.

Sometimes, it is convenient to temporarily disable code:

javascript
/* Commented code
alert('Hello');
*/
alert('World');
Use shortcuts!

In most editors, a line of code can be commented out using the shortcut Ctrl+/ for single-line comments, and shortcuts like Ctrl+Shift+/ can be used for multiline comments (select the code and then press the shortcut). For Mac computers, Cmd should be used instead of Ctrl, and Option instead of Shift.

No nested comments are supported!

Do not nest another /.../ inside /.../.

The following code will throw an error and fail to execute:

javascript
/*
  /* Nested comments ?!? */
*/
alert( 'World' );
Comment on your code, what's there to hesitate about!

Comments will increase the total amount of code, but this is not a problem at all. There are many tools that can help you minimize the code before deploying it to the server. These tools will remove comments, so they will not appear in the published scripts. Therefore, comments have no negative impact on our production.

In later tutorials, there will be a section on code quality explaining how to write better comments.
